Vue.js is, quite simply, a framework for building user interfaces. Does that sound familiar?
It should, because that's the same thing that React does! In fact, you'll see Vue.js commonly
listed as an alternative to React or Angular. It's lightweight, fast, and
features components like React. Unlike React, Vue.js allows two way data binding
between your Javascript and the DOM.

## Overview

In this tutorial, we'll build a single page app that demonstrates the basic functionality
of Vue.js. We'll create a virtual punching bag!

## Setup

Because this is a demo of Vue itself, there is no need to set up anything else
beyond these project files on your computer.

$ npm install vue
~~~~
